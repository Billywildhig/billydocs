description: A guide on how to configure Sematext Experience with custom time thresholds for page loads and HTTP requests. Easily configure On-Page Transactions and URL Groups as well.

Different websites will have different performance requirements. We recommend a time threshold of 2 seconds for page loads and HTTP requests. This is also the default we provide. You can change the settings on the Configure Requirements page. Time thresholds are defined in milliseconds.

### Page Loads and HTTP requests

To configure time thresholds for page loads and requests, click on Configure Requirements in the App sidebar menu and adjust the "Page Load Time Threshold". To configure time threshold for requests, adjust the "Request Time Threshold". Below you can see a screenshot of both Page Load time threshold and Request Time Threshold set to two seconds.

### URL Groups

To configure time thresholds for specific URL group, click on Configure Requirements in the App sidebar menu and adjust the time threshold input next to each URL group. You can also go to the URL Groups page and adjust the thresholds there.

### On-Page Transactions

To configure time thresholds for On-Page transactions, open On-Page Transactions in the App sidebar menu, and select *Edit* in table actions for the transaction you want to adjust. If the transaction definition has not been created yet, you can create it by clicking on the *Add button* in the top left. In either case you will see the *Target Time* field that can be adjusted.
