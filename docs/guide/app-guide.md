title: What is an App?
description: Sematext Cloud is a modern monitoring, log management, transaction tracing, and real user monitoring system. Dashboarding is system's powerful feature for cohesive data analysis from multiple data sources such as logs, metrics, and events.

Apps act as containers for your data. You can store performance metrics or logs about servers, containers, software, programming languages and databases. Our Apps have dozens of monitoring integrations with software like Docker, AWS, Solr, Elasticsearch, [and many more](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/), while our log integration works with several different [log shippers](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/#log-shippers). Every App is isolated and standalone. Pricing is defined per-App meaning you have more control over your costs, with awesome free tiers for both [Monitoring](https://sematext.com/spm/pricing/) and [Logs](https://sematext.com/logsene/pricing/).

Because Apps are standalone, they can be configured to give access to certain roles. You can create custom access roles for different members of your team. This also allows you to transfer the ownership of an App to another member. All configurations and settings will be kept after the transfer. Having role-based access control for every single App in Sematext Cloud makes it easier for you to manage both Apps and team members.
