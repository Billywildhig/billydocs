title: Sematext Logs Guide - Logging Mananagement App
description: Sematext Cloud is a modern monitoring, log management, transaction tracing, and real user monitoring system that aggregates and structures your logs across various languages and platforms. It is a suite of products that combine high-quality logging experience with other monitoring and alerting devops tools helping fix production issues

Logs are everywhere, networks, servers, containers, cloud infrastructure, IoT, applications, load balancers, everywhere.

In order to draw meaningful insights from the sea of logs your IT system administrators, developers, IT operators, and security professionals comb on daily basis, you need a scalable platform that centralizes all these logs. Our SaaS / on-premise centralized logging management service provides ability to search and help your devops team find common exceptions, detect patterns in behaviors, and solve SLA, performance issues, and availability problems.

Collect and send data from any part of your stack with different [log shippers available](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/sending-log-events/), and centralize and index logs from operating systems, containers, network devices, AWS infrastructure, application access logs, custom events, and more. 

[Our logging platform](https://sematext.com/logsene/) provides both ability to create your own queries through its [Elasticsearch API](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/search-through-the-elasticsearch-api/) as well as rich, yet simple query syntax very much like the [query syntax](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/search-syntax/) used by Google.


Search and analyze your IT enterprise logs using Sematext advanced analytics tools, identify and compare patterns and anomalies, monitor applications and infrastructure, and alert your whole IT infrastructure with a single pane of glass. 

You can also integrate [alerts](https://sematext.com/docs/alerts/) with commonly used collaboration and messaging software such as [Hipchat](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/alerts-hipchat-integration/), [Slack](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/alerts-slack-integration/), [Big Panda](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/alerts-bigpanda-integration/), [PagerDuty](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/alerts-pagerduty-integration/), [VictorOps](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/alerts-victorops-integration/). Use these services to continuously monitor large volume of data and logs, and ensure that you are alerted in time.

Check [integrations](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/) pages for more information. 

Logs are aggregated by time and shown in the logging management web application, where you have the ability to search for specific terms, narrow down time ranges, filter fields, setup alerts and more. The supported Search API's are URI based search, Request body based search, Real time GET operation, and Multiple GET and Multiple Search operations in a single request.

Use [command line tool](https://sematext.com/blog/logsene-cli/) used for viewing, searching, filtering, and analyzing of log entries across all your logs from all your apps.

Correlate views across multiple logs from different components and get a full stack observability. Share metrics reports and dashboards so that the entire team has access to the same data, while RBAC (Role Based Access Control) provides different access and user permissions to the team.

Regulatory expectations to store all logs require centralized log management solution, and Sematext logging management platform addresses these requirements. Monitor health of your whole application and infrastructure stack using our Cloud service and ensure that data is properly secured and stored. 

We can help you focus on your core competencies and provide your IT managers with tools necessary for complete logs management together with your stack metrics monitoring, a single pane of glass for full observability. Should security incident or outage take place, you need insight that allows you to quickly resolve the issue and avoid poor customer experience.
