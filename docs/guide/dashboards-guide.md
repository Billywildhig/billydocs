title: Dashboards Guide
description: Sematext Cloud is a modern monitoring, log management, transaction tracing, and real user monitoring system. Dashboarding is system's powerful feature for cohesive data analysis from multiple data sources such as logs, metrics, and events. 

Sematext Cloud, our IT enterprise platform for logs and application real-time analytics and data visualization, is designed to make the dashboarding powerful feature for cohesive data analysis as well as easy navigation and customization of dashboard reports by your DevOps or business team. 

Dashboards provide helpful views of KPIs (key performance indicators) and consist of multiple visualization components which can accumulate data from multiple data sources such as logs, metrics, and events into one centralized pane of observability glass. You can create goal specific reports with various metrics visualized, and share them in a meeting to show what that data says about your business.

On the other hand, logs data is hard to analize and can be extremely tedious to understand. Dashboards help you get visual view of operations happening in you environment, and often play key role in decision making. Moreover, dashboards provide means to bring together one or more reports and display them in single report view for easy correlation and investigation.

Below is the image of already created Dashboards Report identifying section's top navigation elements and showing active dashboard section in the left sidebar navigation. We are using it to monitor the health of our cloud based application performance monitroing platform. It is made up of several different technologies used in our stack, namely Hbase, Kafka, and Mysql, and for each piece of tech in the stack a monitoring application has been created.
