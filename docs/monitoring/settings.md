## Report Settings

Once you [create a Monitoring App](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/quick-start/#creating-a-monitoring-app), and start your Agent, it will have a set of default [reports and components](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/reports-and-components/). You can edit, clone and delete these reports or create new ones. You can also define [report variables](https://sematext.com/docs/dashboards/report-variables/) to dynamically fiter and group data in a report.

Based on what type of Monitoring Integration you chose, more reports get created by default. In this OpenSearch integration you can see three more reports are created by default.
