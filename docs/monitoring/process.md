title: Sematext Process Monitoring
description: Sematext Inventory Monitoring gives you insight into your whole infrastructure automatically based on the applications, containers, servers and general infrastructure you are monitoring.

This should explain the new Inventory Monitoring feature, and have the following sections.

- overview
- how it works
- what it does
- what it solves 
- how it helps with observability/troubleshooting/debugging/etc…

We’ve added some valuable enhancements to Sematext Monitoring. You can now use Sematext for Process Monitoring and Inventory Monitoring.  Process monitoring gives you visibility into processes that use the most CPU or memory, regardless of whether they are running inside containers, in the cloud, your own VMs or bare-metal servers.
