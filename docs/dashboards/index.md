title: Sematext Dashboards
description: Sematext Cloud is a modern monitoring, log management, transaction tracing, real user monitoring, and synthetic monitoring system. Dashboards are a powerful feature for cohesive data analysis from multiple data sources such as logs, metrics, and events.

Dashboards are your central location where you put everything together. Logs, application performance metrics, infrastructure inventory and processes, cluster data with Docker and Kubernetes metrics, and events that give you insight into what is happening with your system in real-time. Everything in one place. 

You can create specific reports with various metrics, correlate them with logs and event timelines to get to the bottom of issues much easier.

Log data is hard to analyze and can be extremely tedious to understand. Dashboards provide the means to display one or more metrics in parallel with logs, and display them in a unified report for easy correlation and investigation.

## Creating Dashboards
To create a Dashboard, start by going to the Dashboards screen and click the **+ Add New Dashboard** button. Give your Dashbord a name and click save.

## Reports and Components
Every Dashboard can have multiple Reports that act as buckets for your metrics, logs, infrastructure, events, and experience data. The data in one report are separated into components, which all live under the same roof in a Dashboard for easy correlation and troubleshooting.
