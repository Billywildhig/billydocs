title: Supported Log Event Timestamp Formats 
description: @timestamp value is used by Sematext logging management solution as the moment when the event was generated, and supports timezone specified by using *+/-* notation as well as ISO, default Log4j, and Graylog time format

One of the key things when working with time based data is the timestamp that represents the moment when the event was generated. Sematext Logs Management expects the time of the event to be provided in the `@timestamp` field. The following `@timestamp` value formats are currently supported by our logging management solution:

1.   ISO date with timezone information, for example:

        2016-06-22T10:00:00Z
        2016-01-04T15:30:10.474+00:00
        2016-01-04T15:30:10,474+00:00
        2016-06-22T10:00:00.000Z
        2016-06-22T10:00:00,000Z
        2016-06-22T10:00:00Z
        2016-06-22T10:00:00.298Z
        2016-06-22T10:00:00.298

2. Timezone specified by using *+/-* notation, for example:

        2014-03-23T22:04:23-0400

3. Default Log4j date and time format, for example:

        2016-06-24 10:38:09,758
        2016-06-24 10:38:09

4. Time since epoch, for example:

        1466595234226

5. Graylog date format, for example:

        1385053862.3072
        1444128321.426
        2015-11-13T09:21:45.298

6. NGINX non-ISO date format, for example:
        
        22/Apr/2016:14:40:13 +0200

**Please note:**

  - if `@timestamp` field is not provided Sematext will set `@timestamp` to the time when the event is received by Sematext.
  - if the `@timestamp` field is not parsable by Sematext, the `@timestamp` field will be set to the time when the event is received by Sematext.
  - if time specified inÂ `@timestamp` does not include timezone information, the Logs App will assume UTC.
