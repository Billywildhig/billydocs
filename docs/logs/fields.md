title: Fields
description: Sematext's Logs management App looks for special fields in logs, namely host, source, facility, severity, syslog-tag, tags, message, and @timestamp

Tags from the [Common Schema](../tags/common-schema) apply to Sematext Logs as well. Additionally, there are Logs-specific fields which also get special treatment:

  - host
  - source
  - facility
  - severity
  - syslog-tag
  - tags
  - message
  - @timestamp

To read more, check out our [Common Schema for Logs Tags](../tags/common-schema/#logs-tags).
