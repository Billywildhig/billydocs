### Manual Correlation

Manual correlation can be done using the [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen) feature. With [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen) you can compare and correlate selected Logs report with any Monitoring, Infrastructure or Experience reports. Correlation is also possible with Events or Synthetic Monitors. It can be used to correlate even with the same Logs report but with different filters and groups in the two different screens.
