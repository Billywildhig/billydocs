By connecting to port **80** (or 443, if you want HTTPS) on **logsene-receiver.sematext.com** / **logsene-syslog-receiver.eu.sematext.com** (if using Sematext Cloud Europe), you can use the Elasticsearch API to search through your data, in the same way [you can send it](sending-log-events).

[Logs Apps](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/) comes with its own UI, which integrates nicely with other Sematext Apps, such as [Monitoring](https://sematext.com/spm/) (seeÂ the [Monitoring Documentation](../monitoring)). You can correlate data in any Logs App with any other Logs, [Monitoring](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/), [Synthetics](https://sematext.com/docs/synthetics/) or [Experience](https://sematext.com/docs/experience/) App by using [Split Screen](https://sematext.com/docs/guide/split-screen/).

You can also use [Kibana](kibana)  or deploy your own UI or custom scripts.

Besides web UI, there's also [Logsene CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logsene-cli), a command line interface for searching through logs, with the ability to pipe the output to `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort` and other useful shell commands.
