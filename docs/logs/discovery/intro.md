description: Logs Discovery Introduction

Logs discovery aims to automate the classification and shipping of your infrastructure-crucial log files and container logs. With a simple control plane at your disposal it's easy to explore and manage discovered log sources across bare-metal/virtual machines and containers.

## Features

### Contextual log discoveries

Each log file is linked to the service that's writing to it. Log file metadata reveals some fundamental attributes of a file, like the disk device where it is located, size, inode number and so on.

### Automatic log shipping

Setting up log shipping is straightforward and it boils down to selecting your logs destination.

### Log parsing

A predefined set of regular expression patterns are automatically applied to a log file making it convenient to get started without additional hassle.

### Glob patterns

Include and exclude glob patterns provide fine-grained control over which log files are shipping to Sematext Cloud.
