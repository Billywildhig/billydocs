description: The first true hosted ELK Stack as a service with Elasticsearch API and integrated Kibana

Kibana is analytics and visualization platform used to perform various searches and create logging analytics dashboards.

Kibana is fully intergrated with Sematext's cloud and on-premises service used to monitor, search, analyze, and visualize your data interactively. Customize dashboards and use Kibana to analyze log data and perform advanced management tasks.

Click on the **Kibana** button in the App Settings dropdown from the [Logs section](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs) in our infrastructure & application monitoring and log management platform.

Once you're there, you can customize your dashboard to do all kinds of searches and visualizations to your data.

If you want even more flexibility, you can [install Kibana locally and point it to your Logs App](faq/#kibana).
