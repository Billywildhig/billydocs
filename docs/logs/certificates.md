title: Sematext Syslog Certificates
description: Sematext log management syslog certificates

In addition to TCP, UDP and RELP, Sematext also supports RFC-5425 compliant Syslog over TLS.
See instructions for [rsyslog](rsyslog) and [syslog-ng](syslog-ng) on how to configure them.
To ship logs to Sematext via Syslog securely over TLS use the following certificates:

* [Root certificate](https://apps.sematext.com/cert/DigiCert_Global_Root_CA.pem)
* [Intermediate certificate](https://apps.sematext.com/cert/DigiCertCA.pem)
