description: Configuring metadata for Alerts

The Meta tab lets you tag alert rules with a specific color and specify further details, like Runbook and Description.

The colored tag will appear next to logs that triggered the alert in the [Logs Table](../logs/searching-log-events/) so you can easily filter and find these errors.
