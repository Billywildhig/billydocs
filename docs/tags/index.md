title: Tags 
description: A Tag is an attribute of a data point (or metric) that could be used for grouping and filtering.

The [Sematext Agent](../agents/sematext-agent) automatically collects the following tags and sends them periodically to Sematext Cloud. 

It is not recommended to use the names from our [Common Schema](./common-schema) for your own, [Custom Tags](./custom-tags).

Tags you define can be grouped and filtered in dashboards and reports, including tags that are automatically configured in our [Agents](../agents). Take a look at the [Common Schema](./common-schema) to see all the tags we gather automatically.

The point of having tags is to simplify using Sematext Cloud. By using our full-text search, filtering and grouping features, you can quickly view the data you are looking for.

Tags you define by yourself or tags defined on the environment level by our Agents, can be updated and edited, while tags from the [Common Schema](./common-schema) cannot be updated.
