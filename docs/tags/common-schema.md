title: Sematext Common Schema
description: The following tags are treated as special in Sematext Cloud and cannot be used as custom tags or in App agent YAMLs. They are used to correlate data across multiple Apps.

Tags are sent by the Sematext Agent as part of every data point or log event and they are shown in UI as filters.

The following tags should not be used as [custom tags](./custom-tags) or in in [App agent](../agents/sematext-agent/app-agent/) YAMLs.


## Common Tags

The tags below are applicable to all metrics/logs types:

| Tag Name  | Description  | Synonymous Tags
|:--|:--|:--
| os.host | Hostname of the host where the agent is running | host, hostname, host.id, host.name, server.name |
| token | Sematext App Token |
| measurement | Reserved as per Influx Line Protocol |
| tag.alias.type | Denotes the Tag Alias type |

## Logs Tags

Refer to this list of default fields for Logs Apps. The tags below are applicable to all logs types:

| Tag Name  | Description  | Synonymous Tags
|:--|:--|:--
| host | A single-valued field and should contain the ID, typically a hostname, of the device or server sending logs. |
| source | A single-valued field and should contain the ID or descriptor of where the data is coming from. For example, this could be a file name or even a full path to a filename, or the name of the application or process |
| facility | A single-valued field used by syslog to indicate the [facility level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility_levels). Sematext stores the keyword values of these levels (such as *user* or *auth*). |
| severity | A single-valued field and should contain the log level, such as *error* or *info*. |
| syslog-tag | A single-valued field used by syslog to indicate the name and the PID of the application generating the event (for example, **httpd\[215\]:**). |
| tags | A multi-valued array field that can contain zero or more tags (for example, `"tags": ["solr", "search"]`). When searching for logs with these tags you can filter by using `tags:solr AND tags:search`. Tags can also contain multiple tokens separated by space, but they are still treated as a single value (for example. `"tags": ["solr search"]`). |
| message | A string field that can contain any sort of text (usually the original log line or some other free text). |
| @timestamp | A date field, on which log retention is based. If it's not present, it will be added automatically when the log event is received by Sematext. See [Supported Date Formats](../logs/supported-date-formats). |
| error.id | A reserved field for errors |
| error.message | A reserved field for errors |
| error.type | A reserved field for errors |
| span.id | Building block of a trace in distributed tracing |
| trace.id | Building block of a trace in distributed tracing |
| geo.ip | IP address defining the location associated with the log line |
| geo.location | A latitude and longitude defining the location associated with the log line |
| geo.city_name | The city associated with the log line |
| geo.region | The region associated with the log line |
| geo.region_iso_code | The region ISO code assiciated with the region in the log line |
| geo.country_name | The country associated with the log line |
| geo.country_iso_code | The ISO code associated with the country in the log line |
| geo.continent_name | The continent associated with the log line |

All of these fields are optional, but their use is strongly encouraged. If found in logs with low-enough cardinality, all distinct values of these fields will be loaded and shown in the UI as filters and thus allowing one to very quickly narrow down the search.


## Operating System Tags

Below are the OS related tags sent as part of OS metrics/logs. They are collected from the host the [Sematext Agent](../agents/sematext-agent) is running on. They're mapped to the `os.host` tag.

| Tag Name  | Description
|:--|:--
| os.disk | Human readable name of the block device |
| os.disk.mountpoint | Mount point for the disk in the file system |
| os.disk.fs.type | Type of the file system associated with the device |
| os.network | Name of the network interface |
| os.uuid | Unique ID based on SMBIOS specification |
| os.distro.name | Distribution name of the OS. e.g. `ubuntu` |
| os.distro.version | Version of the OS. e.g. `16.04` |
| os.kernel | Version of the Kernel. e.g. `4.4.0-130-generic` |
| jvm.version | Version of JVM, if available in `PATH` |
| virtualization | Virtualization Type. Possible values are `BareMetal`, `VM`, `Container` |
| - | All user-defined container labels. These tag are mapped to `os.host` and `container.id` |

## Cloud Tags

The cloud metadata from AWS, Azure and GCE instances are collected as tags. They're mapped to the `os.host` tag.

| Tag Name  | Description | Supported Cloud Providers
|:--|:--|:--
|  cloud.type |  Provider Type |  AWS, GCE, Azure |
|  cloud.instance.id | Instance Identifier |  AWS, GCE, Azure |
|  cloud.instance.name | Instance Name |  Azure, GCE |
|  cloud.instance.type | Instance Type |  AWS, GCE, Azure |
|  cloud.region |  Region |  AWS, Azure |
|  cloud.zone | Availability Zone |  AWS, GCE |
|  cloud.project | Project Identifier |  GCE |
|  -  | User-defined tags |  AWS, GCE, Azure |

To collect user-defined cloud tags from AWS, Azure or GCE environment you need to define the IAM roles listed below:

1. AWS - EC2 Instances should be created with AWS IAM Role that has policy `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`.
    See [AWS/EC2 User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) for more info.
2. Azure - To fetch resource tags for Virtual Machines, you need to grant `Reader` role to its Resource Group in Azure Resource Manager.
    See [Access Azure Resource Manager API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/tutorial-linux-vm-access-arm) for more info.
3. GCE - In GCE user-defined tags are called labels. To read labels, the instance needs `roles/compute.viewer` IAM role.
    See [Granting Roles to Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource) for more info.

Cloud tags collection is enabled by default. Â To disable Cloud tags
collection set `cloud.metadata-enabled` to `false` in `/opt/spm/properties/st-agent.yml` and
restart Sematext Agent using `sudo service sematext-agent restart`.
