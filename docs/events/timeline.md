title:Timeline/Histogram

All events are time-based. This means they are presented on a histogram (aka timeline). Chart
contains events grouped by event type. You can rely on colors presented on the chart to quickly
figure out what are the most common event types at each point in time. Events chart behaves
the same way as all other charts in [Sematext Cloud](https://sematext.com/cloud/).

Events are listed in the Events table just below the chart. Each event row includes the severity, timestamp, a message with all the event details, event fields, and the Sematext App associated with the event. The event rows can be expanded to reveal more information about each event. It's also possible to apply filtering to event fields. Some fields are hyperlinked with other areas of Sematext Cloud to enable easy identification of any potential issue in your environment.
