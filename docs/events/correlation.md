title:Events Correlations and Components

## Events Correlations

Here's an **Events correlation panel** expanded in an Apache Monitoring App with server metrics. You can **correlate Events with Metrics** and see how certain events affected metric spikes. 

You can also **correlate Events with Logs** for full observability. This means you can have **Events, Logs, and Metrics on the same timeline**, saving you huge amounts of time when debugging.

In addition to showing Events as a time-series chart, you have a detailed **Events Stream** where you can **search and filter** them. Events have tags, making it that much easier.

## Events Components

There are **two main components** that make up **Events**. Both can be added to dashboards just as Metrics and Logs components.

You can create Events and attach them to any particular Monitoring, Logs, or Experience App, or dashboard. It's great for leaving notes alongside auto-generated data. It supports markdown format and provides a perfect way to provide human input which can later be used for presentations and reminders.
