title: Sematext App Transfer
description: Inviting team members to your account means they get access to all your Apps, dashboards, notification hooks, alert rules, and everything else!

No level of Access can change the Owner status of an App. To transfer the 
ownership of an App, use the App Transfer feature. Select an App, enter the user
you wish to transfer the App to, and hit **Transfer**.

To transfer one of your Apps to another user, go to the 
[App Transfer page](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/team/transfers) in Sematext Cloud (or [App Transfer in Sematext Cloud EU](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/team/transfers)).
