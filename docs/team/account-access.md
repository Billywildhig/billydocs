title: Sematext Account Access
description: Inviting team members to your account means they get access to all your Apps, dashboards, notification hooks, alert rules, and everything else!  

By inviting a user to your Account, you invite them to your **whole account**, 
so they get access to **all** your Apps, Dashboards, notification
hooks, alert rules, and integrations.

To share your Account with other users, go to the 
[Team page](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/team/accounts) on Sematext Cloud.
