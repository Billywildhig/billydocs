title: Sematext Team and Access Sharing
description: There are two levels of access rights. Account Members and App Guests. Inviting team members to your account means they get access to all your Apps, Dashboards, notification hooks, alert rules, and everything else! You can invite team members to individual Apps and access Apps youâ€™ve been invited to. 


There are two levels of access rights: 

- **Account Members** - invite others to your **whole account**
- **App Guests** - invite others **only to a particular App**

And a third option called:

- **Transfer Apps** - transferring ownership status of an App to another user

You can assign three different Roles for users you give access to your account 
or particular Apps:

- **User**
- **Admin**
- **Billing Admin**

And a fourth option: 

- **Owner** - assigned if you transfer the ownership of an App to another user.


## Account Members vs. App Guests
Account members and App guests are not exclusive. You can use both of
these two access types at the same time. You could share your account with
some users, and share specific Apps with other users.

## Account Members
By [inviting a user to your account](./account-members), you invite them to your **whole account**, 
so they get access to **all** your Apps, Dashboards, notification
hooks, alert rules, and integrations.

They can also create new Apps under your account and invite other users. 
Depending on the role you assign to invitees, they may be able to administer 
your Apps, Dashboards, users and even billing info (change app plan, assign 
credit card, etc). 

Account Sharing is very convenient because as soon as a new
Sematext App is added to your account or new Dashboard is created, all
users added to your account get access to it. Of course, the level of
access depends on the role you assigned to each person.


## App Guests
[App Guests](./app-guests) is **restricted only to a particular App**. Nothing besides the 
shared App is accessible to the invited user. 

*__Note__: Dashboards are at the account level and can thus be shared only through account Members.*

This option is useful if you want to be restrictive about which Apps can be 
seen by others or what kind of changes they can make. 

By only configuring App Guests, guests **can't see or edit alert rules** created 
by your team, they **can't use your team's notification hooks**, meaning they're 
**limited only to the App they have access to**.

## Transfer Apps
No level of Access can change the Owner status of an App. To transfer the 
ownership of an App, use the [Transfer Apps](./transfer-apps) feature. Click the **Start Ownership Transfer** 
button to open the side modal, select an app, click **Transfer to...** to proceed, enter the email of the
user you want to transfer the App to, and hit **Transfer Ownership**.

## Typical use of Roles in an Organization or Team
Typically you might have one person create an account by [signing up](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/registration). 
This account might be considered [a _parent_ account](./user-roles) for your whole organization or team.  

- [**Owner**](./user-roles/#owner) - the person who created the account would be its `OWNER`
- [**Admin**](./user-roles/#admin) - invited users can be given the `ADMIN` role, which gives them read, write, and invite rights 
- [**User**](./user-roles/#user) - the `USER` role grants read rights and limited write rights
- [**Billing Admin**](./user-roles/#billing-admin) - the `BILLING_ADMIN` is able to define, edit, and delete credit cards and choose plans to be used for Apps in the 
account.
