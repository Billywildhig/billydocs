title: Sematext Team and Access Sharing
description: There are two levels of access rights. Account and App Access. Inviting team members to your account means they get access to all your Apps, Dashboards, notification hooks, alert rules, and everything else! You can invite team members to individual Apps and access Apps youâ€™ve been invited to. 


There are two levels of access rights: 

- **Account Access** - invite others to your **whole account**
- **App Access** - invite others **only to a particular App**

And a third option called:

- **App Transfer** - transferring ownership status of an App to another user

You can assign three different Roles for users you give access to your account 
or particular Apps:

- **User**
- **Admin**
- **Billing Admin**

And a fourth option: 

- **Owner** - assigned if you transfer the ownership of an App to another user.


## Account vs. App Access
Account Access and App Access are not exclusive. You can use both of
these two access types at the same time. You could share your Account with
some users, and share specific Apps with other users.

## Account Access
By inviting a user to your Account, you invite them to your **whole account**, 
so they get access to **all** your Apps, Dashboards, notification
hooks, alert rules, and integrations.

They can also create new Apps under your account and invite other users. 
Depending on the role you assign to invitees, they may be able to administer 
your Apps, Dashboards, users and even billing info (change app plan, assign 
credit card, etc). 

Account Sharing is very convenient because as soon as a new
Sematext App is added to your account or new Dashboard is created, all
users added to your account get access to it. Of course, the level of
access depends on the role you initially assigned to each person.


## App Access
App Access is **restricted only to a particular App**. Nothing besides the 
shared App is accessible to the invited user. 

*__Note__: Dashboards are at the account level can can thus be shared only through Account Access.*

This option is useful if you want to be restrictive about which Apps can be 
seen by others or what kind of effect they have on your team. 

By only configuring App Access, guests **can't see nor edit alert rules** created 
by your team, they **can't use your team's notification hooks**, meaning they're 
**limited only to the App they have access to**.

## App Transfer
No level of Access can change the Owner status of an App. To transfer the 
ownership of an App, you need to use the App Transfer feature. Select an App and enter the user
you wish to transfer the App to, and hit **Transfer**.

## Typical use of Roles in an Organization
Typically you might have one person create an account by [signing up](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/registration). 
This account might be considered a _parent_ account for your whole organization.  

### Owner
Since the person who created the account would be its `OWNER`, this person
is typically a team leader or manager, somebody with the responsibility to 
oversee the DevOps pipeline of the whole organization. They might then choose 
to share the whole Account with every other person from the team/organization 
to allow others to easily access all Apps created under that account.

### Admin
Some invited users might be given the `ADMIN` role, which gives
them read, write, and invite rights. 

### User
Other invitees might get the
`USER` role, which mostly only grants read rights with the ability to
create and edit their own Dashboards/Alerts/Subscriptions which are
available to everyone under the shared account. 

### Billing Admin
In some cases, the account `OWNER` will not be able to handle billing-related 
info and will want to invite `BILLING_ADMIN`s who will be able to define, 
edit, and delete credit cards and choose plans to be used for Apps in the 
account.
