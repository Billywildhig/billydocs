Use them together for seamless infrastructure and application monitoring integration with alert-messaging, and begin sending webhook notifications to your customized devops team channel

Pushover is a service to receive instant push notifications on your phone or tablet from a variety of sources.  On the server side, Pushover provides an HTTP API for queueing messages to deliver to devices addressable by User or Group Keys. On the device side, Pushover's iOS, Android, and Desktop clients receive those push notifications, show them to the user, and store them for offline viewing.

Sematext has threshold, anomaly and / or heartbeat Alerts integration with Pushover's alert/incident management and notification tools.
