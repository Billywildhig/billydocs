title: Connected Apps

### Connected Apps

Connecting a Monitoring App to a Logs App will pre-select that Logs App when you decide to correlate metrics. When you
receive an alert notification for an App, the alert notification will automatically charts from
connected Apps, and thus provide more information and context for you. You can connect any two Apps you have access to,
regardless of their type. A single app can be connected to any number of other Apps. 

To connect Apps go to App Table View and choose Connect App from Integration Menu.
