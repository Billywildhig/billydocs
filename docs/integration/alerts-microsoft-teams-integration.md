title: Microsoft Teams Alerts Integration
description: Sematext threshold, anomaly and / or heartbeat Alerts integration with Microsoft Teams. Use them together to get the information about each notification quickly and on any device.

## In Microsoft Teams

**1.** Create a [Microsoft Teams account](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) if you don't have one already and create a new team and channel that will be used to receive the notifications from Sematext.

To receive incoming notifications from Sematext add and configure a new integration in Microsoft Teams:

**2.** Select **...** options for your team and click **Manage team**:

**8.** Finally the webhook URL will be displayed. You need to copy it and store it - it will be used when configuring the Microsoft Teams notification hook in Sematext. Once you have it stored, click **Create** finishing the webhook creation.

Having the **Incoming Webhook** configured and having the webhook URL we can add the notification to Sematext. 

## In Sematext

**1.** Navigate to [Notification Hooks](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/webhook-create) and select Microsoft Teams card to create a new Microsoft Teams notification hook.

Next, click the **Send Test Notification** button. Microsoft Teams returns **1** indicating everything is configured correctly. Check your Microsoft Teams channel for the test message from Sematext. 

Once the test message is visible click the **Save Notification Hook** button to save your configuration. 

That's it. Notifications sent to Microsoft Teams can also be sent via other channels such as e-mail, Pagerduty, Nagios, etc. Check [alerts](/integration) to learn more about other channels and types of alerts available.
