title: Spike.sh Alerts Integration
description: Sematext threshold, anomaly and / or heartbeat Alerts integration with Spike.sh. Use them together to get the information about each notification quickly and on any device.

## In Spike.sh

**1.** Create an account at [Spike.sh](https://spike.sh) if you don't have one already.

To be able to receive incoming notifications we need to add and configure a new integration. To do that:

**2.** Go to the **Integrations** page and click **New integration**:

**4.** Provide the name, description of the integration. Choose the service that it should be added to, the escalation policy and the acknowledge time:

**5.** Once created click the **Copy Webhook** link:

**6.** Finally click **Copy** button in the displayed modal window and note down the URL that was copied into the clipboard:

Having the **Integration** configured and having the ** Webhook URL** we can add the notification to Sematext. 

## In Sematext

**1.** Navigate to [Notification Hooks](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/webhook-create) and select Spike.sh card to create a new Spike.sh notification hook.

Next, click the **Send Test Notification** button. Spike.sh returns **OK** indicating everything is configured correctly. Check your Spike.sh integration for the test message from Sematext. 

Once the test message is visible click the **Save Notification Hook** button to save your configuration. 

That's it. Notifications sent to Spike.sh can also be sent via other channels such as e-mail, Pagerduty, Nagios, etc. Check [alerts](/integration) to learn more about other channels and types of alerts available.
