title: Express.js Monitoring Integration
description: Sematext Express.js monitoring integration is available as an npm package and required as any other Node.js module. Request rate and event loop latency, memory, http server stats, garbage collection and other Node.js reports and dashboards are available out of the box. Including HTTP logs and Application logs for API-specific troubleshooting and debugging.

This is the Express.js monitoring and logging agent for Sematext, written entirely in Node.js without CPU and memory overhead. It's easy to install and require in your source code.

## Sematext Express.js Agent Quick Start
This lightweight, open-source [Express.js monitoring agent](https://github.com/sematext/sematext-agent-express) collects Node.js process and performance metrics and sends them to Sematext. It is available as an [npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/sematext-agent-express/) that can be added to Node.js source code like any other npm module.

First you install the npm module.
```bash
# Terminal
npm i sematext-agent-express
```

### Configure Environment

Make sure to configure your ENVIRONMENT variables before adding `sematext-agent-express`. You can do this either by exporting the variables to your environment or by using `dotenv`. We suggest you use [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

#### Export env vars

If you are using the US region of Sematext Cloud:

```bash
export REGION=US
export SPM_TOKEN=<YOUR_MONITORING_TOKEN>
export LOGS_TOKEN=<YOUR_LOGS_TOKEN>
```
_**Note:** The US region is set by default, so you do not need to add an environment variable at all._

If you are using the EU region of Sematext Cloud:

```bash
export REGION=EU
export SPM_TOKEN=<YOUR_MONITORING_TOKEN>
export LOGS_TOKEN=<YOUR_LOGS_TOKEN>
```

#### Use dotenv

```bash
npm i dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.

Add this code if you are using the US region of Sematext Cloud:

```
REGION=US
SPM_TOKEN=<YOUR_MONITORING_TOKEN>
LOGS_TOKEN=<YOUR_LOGS_TOKEN>
```
_**Note:** The US region is set by default, so you do not need to add an environment variable at all._

Add this code if you are using the EU region of Sematext Cloud:

```
REGION=EU
SPM_TOKEN=<YOUR_MONITORING_TOKEN>
LOGS_TOKEN=<YOUR_LOGS_TOKEN>
```

### Configure Agent

Make sure to load the environment variables at the top of your JavaScript entry point file. Then require `sematext-agent-express`.

The Agent has 3 parts:

- `stMonitor` - Monitors metrics and sends to Sematext Monitoring
- `stLogger` - A logger based on `winston`, that will send logs directly to Sematext Logs
- `stHttpLoggerMiddleware` - Express.js middleware function that will send all HTTP endpoint logs to Sematext Logs

#### Usage

```javascript
// Load env vars
require('dotenv').config()

// require all agents
const {
  stMonitor,
  stLogger,
  stHttpLoggerMiddleware
} = require('sematext-agent-express')

// Start monitoring metrics
stMonitor.start()

// ...

// At the top of your routes add the stHttpLoggerMiddleware to send HTTP logs to Sematext
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
app.use(stHttpLoggerMiddleware)

// ...

// Use the stLogger to send all types of logs directly to Sematext
app.get('/api', (req, res, next) => {
  stLogger.info('Hello World.')
  stLogger.error('Some error.')
  res.status(200).send('Hello World.')
})
```

You can use all parts of the Agent of use them separately. It's all up to you.

The Sematext Express.js Agent will start collecting dozens of key metrics and logs right away, and start showing you the performance and health of your Express.js applications immediately.

## Collected Express.js Logs 

The Sematext Express.js Agent collects the following logs for every HTTP request.

### Structured HTTP logs

Here's an example of what a structured HTTP log looks like:

timestamp | message | severity | host | ip | method | url | status | content length | response time
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2019-12-23T21:06:36.615Z | your_message | info/debug/error/warn | your_hostname | 127.0.0.1 | GET/PUT/POST/DELETE | /api/v1 | 2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx | in bytes | in ms

Displayed in `JSON` format:

```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2019-12-23T21:06:36.615Z",
  "message": "HTTP LOG",
  "severity": "info",
  "host": "ip-172-31-29-198",
  "ip": "172.31.29.198",
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "/v1/users",
  "status": "200",
  "contentLength": "-",
  "responseTime": "18.403"
}
```

Using this data, you can create custom dashboards displaying detailed data about all HTTP requests hitting your Express.js application.

## Running the Sematext Express.js Agent in Production
If you want to have a reliable application with high uptime, make sure to use the `cluster` module, with the addition of running the Node.js process with Systemd. This will ensure restarts when your application fails and make rolling updates much easier.

### Use the `cluster` module to run Node.js
To make use of the full power of your server, you should run an instance of your Node.js application on each CPU core. The `cluster` module makes this easier than ever. Create another file called `cluster.js`.

```javascript
// cluster.js

const cluster = require('cluster')
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length
const app = require('./app')
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

const masterProcess = () => Array.from(Array(numCPUs)).map(cluster.fork)
const childProcess = () => app.listen(port)
if (cluster.isMaster) masterProcess()
else childProcess()
cluster.on('exit', (worker) => cluster.fork())
```

Now you can run your app with:
```bash
node cluster.js
```

The cluster will spin up a master process with a dedicated process ID and run `numCPUs` number of worker processes. They will be load balanced in a round-robin fashion from the master process. 

This is not all, you should also make sure to run your Node.js application with Systemd to make it a system service and run automatically on startup and restart itself if it fails.

### Set up Node.js with Systemd
The service files for the things that systemd controls all live under the directory path

```bash
/lib/systemd/system
```

Create a new file there:
```bash
sudo vim /lib/systemd/system/app.service
```

And add this piece of code:
```bash
# /lib/systemd/system/app.service

[Unit]
Description=app.js - running your Node.js app as a system service
Documentation=https://yourwebsite.com
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /absolute/path/to/your/project/app.js
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To use Systemd to control the app you first need to reload the Daemon to register the new file.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Now launch your app with:
```bash
sudo systemctl start app
```

You've successfully launched your Node.js app using Systemd! If it doesn't work for some reason, make sure to check your paths in `ExecStart` are correct.
```bash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /absolute/path/to/your/project/app.js
```
These need to point to the `node` binary and the absolute path to your `app.js` file.

## FAQ

### Can I install Express.js agent on Windows?

Yes. The native modules are automatically compiled during "npm
install" (using node-gyp). On Windows the required build tools like
python or C++ compilers are typically not installed by default.  See
<https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp> for details about the
required compiler and build tools.

### How can I use Node.js agent behind Firewalls / Proxy servers?

By default data is transmitted via HTTPS. If no direct connection is
possible, a proxy server can be used by setting the environment
variable HTTPS\_PROXY=<https://your-proxy>.

### What should I do after upgrading to a new Node.js version?

If you switch the Node.jsÂ version the sematext-express-agent package will
need to be installed again (due to the fact that included native
modules may change from version to version).  After the version
change please run a fresh "npm install" if you added sematext-express-agent
to the dependencies in your package.json or at the very least run
"npm install sematext-express-agent".

### How do I upgrade to the latest version of sematext-express-agent?

To use the latest version of sematext-express-agent we recommend you
install/upgrade using:
```
npm install sematext-express-agent@latest
```

To add the dependency to your package.json simply use:
```
npm install sematext-express-agent@latestÂ --save
```


<!-- ### How can I configure Node.js agent for my app using PM2 process manager?

(todo)

First generate the PM2 config file:
```
pm2 ecosystem
```

This command will create a file called `ecosystem.config.js`.
```javascript
// ecosystem.config.js
module.exports = {
  apps : [{
    name: 'API',
    script: 'app.js',

    // Options reference: https://pm2.io/doc/en/runtime/reference/ecosystem-file/
    args: 'one two',
    instances: 1,
    autorestart: true,
    watch: false,
    max_memory_restart: '1G',
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: 'development'
    },
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production'
    }
  }]
  // ...
};
```

Run PM2 with the config file:
```
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
``` -->
