title: AWS S3 (CloudTrail, Flow logs, ELB access logs, etc.)
description: Ship logs stored in S3 to Sematext Cloud. 

If you have logs stored in S3, you can ship them to Sematext <a
href="https://github.com/sematext/logsene-aws-lambda-s3"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">via this AWS Lambda function</a>. This
method also works for when you periodically upload logs to S3 buckets,
like Amazon CloudTrail does.

You can find step-by-step instructions to set up log shipping under [Custom Integrations --> S3](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/Logsene/overview?appTypeName=Logsene&activeSection=awss3) tab.
