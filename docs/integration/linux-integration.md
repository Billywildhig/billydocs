title: Linux Logs Integration
description: Sematext Linux Logs integration allows you to send systemd's journald logs to Sematext via Logagent over HTTPS.

You can send Linux journal logs to Sematext through Logagent. Once they're in, you can explore them and drill into specifics, such as SSH or Kernel logs.

## Linux Logs Quick Start

With [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), you'd first need to install Logagent:
```bash
sudo npm i -g @sematext/logagent
```

Then configure it to push logs to your Logs App:
```bash
sudo logagent-setup -i $YOUR_LOGS_TOKEN -u https://logs-token-receiver.sematext.com -j
```
Note: if you're in the EU regions, use `-u https://logs-token-receiver.eu.sematext.com` instead.

Finally, start Logagent:
```bash
sudo systemctl start logagent
```

## Troubleshooting

If logs don't come in, it might be due to the last cursor position being >10MB away. If you truncate the journal to less than 10MB, this will be fixed:

```bash
journalctl --vacuum-size=9M
systemctl restart systemd-journal-upload
```

For more details, have a look at our <a href="../journald-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journald integration</a>. There, you can find instructions on how to send journald entries to Sematext Logs without needing a local Logagent. That said, [in most systemd versions](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/15347) you need a local Logagent for an HTTPS connection instead of plain HTTP.

## Exploring logs

Once data is in, you can explore it using the built-in reports or create your own. For example, you can use the Auth report to explore sudo commands:

Other built-in reports include:

- **Kernel**: Logs filtered by the facility 0 (kernel). You will find here all your startup logs, information about crashes, all that you typically see via `dmesg`
- **SSH**: Logs generated by the SSH daemon.
- **Services**: Logs from systemd saying starting/started/stopping/stopped. Look here for unexpected service restarts, for example.
- **Startup&Shutdown**: Logs from the system-shutdown service, as well as the kernel message telling you the Linux version on startup. Look here for reboots.
- **Audit**: Logs from the auditd service, with a syslog tag of `audit` and kernel messages including `selinux` or `audit`
- **Cron**: Logs sent to the cron facility (9). For example, you shell see here if `logrotate` ran properly.
- **YUM/Snap**: Logs labeled with either `yum` or `snapd` syslog tag. Look here for more info on package management.
- **Mail**: Logs sent to the mail facility (2). You can check on your postfix here.
- **DNS**: Messages from the systemd-resolved service. Look here if you suspect DNS resolution issues.
