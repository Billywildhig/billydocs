title: AlertOps Alerts Integration
description: Sematext threshold, anomaly and / or heartbeat Alerts integration with AlertOps - a real-time, intelligent, automated incident management platform. Use them together for seamless infrastructure and application monitoring integration with alert-messaging, and begin sending webhook notifications to reach the appropriate team by using proper workflows, escalation policies and schedules. 

Based on your ruleset, incidents can be automatically opened and closed, depending on whether Sematext reports a problem or a recovery. 

The above scenario and scope for integration is due to the fact that AlertOps has a very flexible and simple API/Webhook configuration feature that can be leveraged with Sematextâ€™s monitoring and alerting capabilities.

## **In AlertOps**
