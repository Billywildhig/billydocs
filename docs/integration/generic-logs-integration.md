title: Generic Logs Integration
description: Sematext Logs supports dozens of different integrations.

You can use Generic Logs Apps if the services from which you want to ship logs are not supported out-of-the-box with [Logs Integrations](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/). Generic Logs Apps can contain logs from various sources and can be structured to fit your needs.

To learn how to ship logs to the Generic Logs App, refer to the [Sending Log Events](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/sending-log-events/#generic-logs-app) section.

If you choose a specific integration App, we will structure the logs and provide out-of-the-box dashboards and [alert rules](https://sematext.com/docs/alerts/) for you within the App. However, for Generic Logs, you will see the logs as they are received by Sematext. Once you start receiving logs via automatic discovery or custom log shippers, you can view all your logs from the default Overview report.

To structure your logs according to your needs, such as extracting metrics or fields from text fields, you can use [Logs Pipelines](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/pipelines/). All the details about how to structure your logs are explained thoroughly in the pipelines documentation. If you have any questions, we're here to help. Don't hesitate to contact us at support@sematext.com.

[Logs Pipelines](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/pipelines/) can also be used to drop unwanted data and fields. Eliminating noise and unwanted logs can result in reducing your costs since we charge based on the daily log volume shipped to Sematext and retention. Refer to [Reducing Log Monitoring Costs](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/reduce-costs-with-pipelines/) and [Plan Recommendations](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/plan-recommendations/) for further information.

You can also navigate to [Logs Usage Screen](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/logs-usage-screen/) from the left menu panel within your App to get insights into historical data concerning daily log volumes received and stored.
