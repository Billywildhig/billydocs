title: Microsoft Teams Alerts Integration
description: Sematext threshold, anomaly and / or heartbeat Alerts integration with Microsoft Teams. Use them together to get the information about each notification quickly and on any device.

## In Microsoft Teams

**1.** Create a [Microsoft Teams account](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) if you don't have one already and create a new team and channel that will be used to receive the notifications from Sematext.

To be able to receive incoming notifications we need to add and configure a new incoming webhook. To do that:

**2.** Select **...** options for your team and click **Manage team**:

**4.** Find the **Incoming Webhook**, chose it and click the **Add to a team** button to include the selected **Incoming Webhook** connector to your team.

**7.** Give your webhook a name and click the **Create** button. As an optional step you can also upload a custom icon for your defined webhook.

**8.** Finally the webhook URL will be displayed. You need to copy it and store it - it will be used when configuring the Microsoft Teams notification hook in Sematext. Once you have it stored, click **Create** finishing the webhook creation.

Having the **Incoming Webhook** configured and having the webhook URL we can add the notification to Sematext.
