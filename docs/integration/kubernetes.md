If you are new to Sematext's Kubernetes Monitoring, the following 4 minute video is a good way to get a sneak-peak.  Note that it's from late 2023 and our Kubernetes monitoring is constantly evolving and improving.

## Monitoring Kubernetes with Sematext

Sematext Monitoring will provide you with detailed insights into your cluster's control plane components and their health, performance metrics, and resource counts, among other important metrics. Speaking of metrics, you can check out [this page](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/metrics/) for a summarized list of key metrics that you can track using Sematext. It also includes a short explanation for each metric.

### Agent Install
To start monitoring Kubernetes with Sematext install the Sematext Agent. Setting up the agent takes less than 5 minutes:

1.  Create a new Infra App in [Sematext Cloud US](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create) (or  [Sematext Cloud Europe](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create)) by choosing the INFRA App card from the list of integrations.
2.  Name your Infra App, select the Kubernetes environment and install the Sematext Agent based on your preferred installation method. Available options include kubectl and a Helm chart.

### Agent Configuration
The Sematext Agent offers a versatile container engine monitoring and visibility solution that is easy to customize. For more information, please refer to our [Agent Configuration for Kubernetes](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/configuration/).


## Shipping Kubernetes logs to Sematext

Due to its nature, Kubernetes can be difficult to debug and without proper tooling this process will take a lot longer than it has to. Sematext helps you shed light on what caused issues with your Kubernetes cluster by collecting Kubernetes logs and events.

All you need to do is use [Discovery](../logs/discovery/setup) to Set Up log shipping:

<img class="content-modal-image" alt="Kubernetes logs - Discovery" src="../../images/integrations/kubernetes-logs-disco.png" title="Kubernetes logs - Discovery">

Once data is in, you can explore it via the built-in reports:

<img class="content-modal-image" alt="Kubernetes logs" src="../../images/integrations/kubernetes-logs.png" title="Kubernetes logs">

If you are looking to use a different type of integration you can check out this [page](https://sematext.com/docs/logagent/installation-docker/#kubernetes-and-openshift).


## Kubernetes Events

Kubernetes events track a wide range of activities within a Kubernetes cluster, making them really important in monitoring and troubleshooting the cluster's health and reliability. They provide detailed information about the state and behavior of resources in the cluster, such as pods, nodes, services, and other objects. That's why you can find these events both in the Kubernetes overview and in a dedicated Events report.

In the top-right corner of the Kubernetes overview, youâ€™ll find a chart with the distribution of all Kubernetes events, coloured by severity, within your selected time range. This is really useful to quickly pinpoint when an incident happened.

<img class="content-modal-image" alt="Kubernetes Events Overview" src="../../images/integrations/k8s-overview-events.png" title="Kubernetes Events Overview">

In Kubernetes Events you can explore and filter all the events received within the selecting time range. They are also color-coded by severity and you can quickly see the event message, the available event tags (fields) and the Infra App name to which they belong. Each event can be expanded to get all the details, nicely structured based on all available event tags and their respective values. 

<img class="content-modal-image" alt="Kubernetes Events" src="../../images/integrations/k8s-events-screen.png" title="Kubernetes Events">

In the expanded view, you can filter the events by each individual tag value, whether to include or exclude it.

For additional information about Kubernetes events tags, please refer to our [Common Schema](https://sematext.com/docs/tags/common-schema/#kubernetes-event-tags).

If desired, the [Sematext Agent can be configured](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/events/) to exclude a number of Kubernetes events.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble sending metrics, try out the latest version of the [Sematext Agent](../agents/sematext-agent/installation/). Additionally, make sure to check out the [Agents Information panel](https://sematext.com/docs/fleet/#agent-information-panel) for any errors, and refer to our [Sematext Monitoring FAQ](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/spm-faq/) for useful tips.

### Cluster Roles / RBAC Rules

In case you have trouble getting data in Kubernetes Master Components reports (e.g. Kubelet, Scheduler, kube-proxy, Etcd, CoreDNS) or some of the Workloads reports (e.g. DaemonSets, StatefulSets), make sure that RBAC is enabled in your cluster. Also you'll need to update your RBAC rules configuration:

**kubectl Installation**

```
kubectl apply -f https://sematext-installer.s3.amazonaws.com/sematext-clusterroles.yaml
```

**Helm Installation**

```
helm repo add sematext https://cdn.sematext.com/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Also, please make sure that your agent is [up to date](https://sematext.com/docs/monitoring/spm-faq/#agent-updating).

### Why we need hostNetwork access and how to turn it off if desired
Check out [our page about hostnetwork](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/hostnetwork/).

### Setting TLS Certificate Paths
While monitoring Kubernetes master components, the Sematext Agent will automatically retrieve certificates from the host machine. 

However, if the necessary paths are not present within the [common paths](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/#certificate-paths), 
some additional configuration will be needed to enable querying of the metrics endpoints.

If the default TLS paths are not applicable, you can specify the correct paths using the [Kubernetes environment variables](https://sematext.com/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/configuration/). 
These configurations can be directly placed within the DaemonSet configuration as shown below:
```yaml 
          env:
            - name: AUTODISCO_VECTOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
              value: sematext-agent-vector
              # ...
            - name: KUBERNETES_KUBELET_KEY_PATH
              value: "/some/custom/path"
              # ...
```
