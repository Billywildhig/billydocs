title: Elastic Container Service (ECS) Logs Integration
description: Whether you're using EC2 or Fargate, forward all container logs to Sematext Cloud. Get insight into your whole ECS Cluster.

By configuring AWS Firelens for AWS ECS on AWS Fargate/EC2, you can forward all your container logs to Sematext and get insight into your whole AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster in one place!

## ECS Logs Quick Start

The ECS Logs integration collects logs from ECS Tasks and Services running in:

- EC2 Container Instances
- Fargate 

To collect logs from EKS, see the [Kubernetes integration](./kubernetes/#shipping-kubernetes-logs-to-sematext).

First of all create an AWS ECS Logs App.

### AWS ECS on AWS Fargate/EC2 With FireLens 

You can forward logs from containers running in AWS ECS on AWS Fargate/EC2 to Sematext with the help of FireLens

- [AWS FireLens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html) - `awsfirelens`

With Firelens you can route logs to another AWS service, like Firehose, or use Fluentd or Fluent Bit. AWS provides the image for Fluentd / Fluent Bit. You need to configure the output module to use http and send the logs to Sematext.

#### 1. Enable FireLens
In the ECS Task Definition, check a checkbox called Enable FireLens integration. Choose Fluent Bit and AWS will populate the image name for you.

AWS will add an additional container called `log_router` to the list of containers in your Task Definition.

#### 2. Configure AWS Metadata for your Log Driver

Make sure you have this section in the `log_router` container configuration.

```json
"firelensConfiguration": {
  "type": "fluentbit",
  "options": {
    "enable-ecs-log-metadata": "true"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Configure the FireLens Log Driver
Next, in the same Task Definition but **for your own container (not the `log_router`)**, you configure the `logConfiguration` like this, where `9c63d337-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-abcc87342d47` is your `LOGS_TOKEN`:

```json
"logConfiguration": {
  "logDriver": "awsfirelens",
  "options": {
    "Format": "json",
    "Header_tag": "sourceName",
    "compress": "gzip",
    "Port": "443",
    "Host": "logs-ecs-receiver.sematext.com",
    "TLS": "on",
    "URI": "/9c63d337-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-abcc87342d47",
    "Match": "*",
    "Name": "http"
  }
}
```

> Note: If you are using the EU region of Sematext you should set the Host like this: `"Host": "logs-ecs-receiver.eu.sematext.com"`

Optionally, you can manually set the `sourceName` of your logs. Instead of `"Header_tag": "sourceName"` you can set `"Header": "sourceName <SOURCE>"` if you want to parse certain types of logs. For example, `"Header": "sourceName nginx"` would parse Nginx logs. Here's an example:

```json
"logConfiguration": {
  "logDriver": "awsfirelens",
  "options": {
    "Format": "json",
    "Header": "sourceName nginx",
    "compress": "gzip",
    "Port": "443",
    "Host": "logs-ecs-receiver.sematext.com",
    "TLS": "on",
    "URI": "/9c63d337-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-abcc87342d47",
    "Match": "*",
    "Name": "http"
  }
}
```
