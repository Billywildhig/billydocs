title: Correlation
description: Split Screen is product-wide correlation and data-pivoting feature. With Split Screen you can compare a selected Synthetics Monitor with any other report or dashboard, even with the same report but with different filters on the two different screens.

### Manual Correlation
Manual correlation can be performed by using the [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen) feature. With [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen) you can compare and correlate the selected Synthetic Monitor with any Monitoring, Logs, Infrastructure or Experience reports. Correlation is also possible with Events. It can even be used to correlate the same Synthetic Monitor but with different filters in the two different screens.

Once you select a report you want to correlate with, itâ€™ll be remembered so that you can quickly toggle it.
